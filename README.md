# Predicting Remaining Useful life of Turbo Engine

The Engine under study is Turbofan engine has many components. a few components are listed they are: Fan, Low pressure compressure(LPC), High pressure compressure(HPC), Low pressure turbine(LPT) and High pressure turbine(HPT).

During operation, degradadtion occurs in each components of the turbo engine. If degradadtion level is exceeded in any components of thresold value the engine said to be failed.

But given the critical nature of operation (considering human lives involved), this form of maintenance strategy is justified. Even then, we need a system that can given us early warning if something is going to fail.

An early warning, in many cases, may help us prepare for the problem, if not prevent it altogether. A sufficiently early warning will enable us to prevent the disaster. But if an early warning is too conservative, it will lead to unnecessary waste of money. So, aim of a predictive maintenance system is to predict the RUL as accurately as possible such that it is neither too early nor too late.
